        <p class="bio">
          I am looking forward to graduating in the Spring of 2022.
          Professionally, I am aspiring to become a software engineer after I
          graduate, ideally at some notable companies I've had my eye on, the
          main ones being a FAANG company but most definitely open to any of
          those who require software engineering abilities. I have a great
          interest in wanting to be a part of a team that will challenge me to
          keep up with the modern technologies and learn more while on the job
          to improve my skills as a programmer. Through my experience, I am not
          the biggest fan of working in a low-level programming environment, so
          full-stack engineering has been the path I am currently working
          towards. I am doing my best to work on my interview skills, knowledge,
          resume, and abilities I will need on the job to make me a great fit
          and candidate that deserves this position. I'm very nervous about
          getting my first job in the field of software engineering, so any tips
          for things I can do or work on before/after graduation would be
          greatly appreciated. I also have a deep interest in probability and
          statistics, so data analytics/science has appealed to me towards that
          field, but I don't plan on pursuing professionally at the moment due
          to the background `most` of the jobs require for it but do look
          forward to working in this field in the far future. I am currently
          working on a few side projects to become a better developer, but don't
          have any finished project where I would be excited to put on my
          portfolio.
