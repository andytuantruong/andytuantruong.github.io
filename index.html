          I am aspiring to be a software engineer when I am finished with my
          studies at Portland State University pursuing a B.S. in Computer
          Science. In terms of narrowing down my career interests, I would love
          to work in both the frontend which is in charge of the UI of the
          application and backend that deals with the behind the scenes server
          and database management; ultimately being a full-stack engineer.
          <br />
          My genuine curiosity to continue learning is a great asset when it
          comes to becoming a better software developer. As a software engineer,
          it is inevitable that technologies, skills, frameworks… etc will
          continue to modernize. The ability to learn and pick up new techniques
          is essential for getting acquainted with the company that I will be
          working at in the future, while staying up-to-date with the newest
          technologies. <br />
          As a software engineer, I would ideally be working in a team setting
          where I can count on my teammates to be a reliable ear to bounce ideas
          and troubleshoot technicalities that may come up in the creation or
          maintainability of functions/applications. In return, I would do the
          same for my teammates because I live by the motto, “Treat others the
          way you want to be treated yourself.” <br />
          Outside of academics, I have a great interest in statistics and math,
          largely due to how often problems both in the real and virtual world
          can be broken down into these areas of mathematical science. With
          these interests, a hobby I enjoy is a game titled Teamfight Tactics
          which is an auto-battler which emphasizes the optimization of
          statistics game to game to have a higher rank on the leaderboard. In
          this game, I have peaked in the top &lt; 1% since the game's release
          in June of 2019.
